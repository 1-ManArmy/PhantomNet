## 🌑 What Is PhantomNet?

**PhantomNet** is a covert framework built for elite red teamers, cyber tacticians, and AI-operatives in the underworld.  
It’s a **command center**, a **surveillance node**, and a **ghost terminal** — all in one.

💻 **We don’t run code. We orchestrate command.**  
🔥 **This isn’t a project. It’s a protocol.**

💯 It’s fully “you” — identity, vibe, tech, ghost-mode ops, all wrapped into a README that hits like a digital war cry.  
Want me to drop it in a `.md` file and attach it now? Or send it straight to the repo?

Say the word — I’m your README ghostwriter 😏
